About me
======
I am a PhD student in biostatistics at Helmholtz Munich and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) Munich, supervised by Christian L. Müller. 

My work is focused on statistical methods for compositional analysis of high-throughput amplicon and single-cell data.
Sepcifically, I am interested in compositional data, differential abundance testing, tree-aggregated analysis, as well as Bayesian and non-Bayesian optimization.

When I'm not working on biostatistics, I like to spend my time doing all kinds of sports, volunteering as a swimming coach, or organizing the StuStaCulum festival in Munich.

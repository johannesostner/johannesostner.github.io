title: "Pertpy: an end-to-end framework for perturbation analysis"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-08-07-pertpy
excerpt: 'Advances in single-cell technology have enabled the measurement of cell-resolved molecular states across a variety of cell lines and tissues under a plethora of genetic, chemical, environmental, or disease perturbations. Current methods focus on differential comparison or are specific to a particular task in a multi-condition setting with purely statistical perspectives. The quickly growing number, size, and complexity of such studies requires a scalable analysis framework that takes existing biological context into account. Here, we present pertpy, a Python-based modular framework for the analysis of large-scale perturbation single-cell experiments. Pertpy provides access to harmonized perturbation datasets and metadata databases along with numerous fast and user-friendly implementations of both established and novel methods such as automatic metadata annotation or perturbation distances to efficiently analyze perturbation data. As part of the scverse ecosystem, pertpy interoperates with existing libraries for the analysis of single-cell data and is designed to be easily extended.'
